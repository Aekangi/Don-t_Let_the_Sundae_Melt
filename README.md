# ***Don't Let the Sundae Dissapear*** 

## **Description**
Don't Let the Sundea Melt is a modern twist to a childhood game. The objective of the game is to guess the letters that make a word before the sundea melts. With each correct guess, the letter will be displayed on the line. However, if the letter guessed does not belong in the word, a part of the sundea will dissapear. The game will end when either the word has been guessed, or the player ran out of guesses. 

## **How to Play**
The game is very simple. One needs to guess the word by clicking letters they think will formulate the word. If the letter exists in the spelling of the word, it will be displayed in the appropriate spot otherwise one by one, each component of the sundea cone will start to dissapear. The sundea has 6 different components to represent the 6 lives in the game:
1. Cherry
2. Sprinkles
3. Hot Fudge
4. Mint ice cream
5. Chocolate ice cream
6. Cone

Hope you enjoy the game :)
