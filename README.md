# ***Don't Let the Sundea Melt*** 

## **Description**
Don't Let the Sundea Melt is a modern twist to a childhood game. The objective of the game is to guess the letters that make a word before the sundea melts. With each correct guess, the letter will be displayed on the line. However, if the letter guessed, does not belong in the word, a part of the sundea cone will dissapear. The game will end when either the word has been guessed, or the player ran out of guesses.
